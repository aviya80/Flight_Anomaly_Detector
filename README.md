# Anomaly Detector

## Introduction
Anomaly Detector is a C++ project developed as part of the Advanced Programming 1 course at Bar Ilan University. It implements various concepts including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design patterns, threading programming, and TCP client-server architecture to analyze flight data and detect potential anomalies.

## Main Concepts
- **OOP Design Patterns**: Utilizes polymorphism and inheritance to enhance code structure and flexibility.
- **Threading Programming**: Implements multithreading to handle multiple clients in parallel efficiently.
- **TCP Client-Server Architecture**: Utilizes a client-server model for communication between components.

## Analyzing Flight Data
The project's primary objective is to analyze given flight data to detect potentially harmful anomalies.

## Design Goals
- Implements client-server architecture to handle multiple clients concurrently.
- Utilizes statistical models to analyze flight data for anomaly detection.
- Employs design patterns such as the Command pattern to ensure code modularity, reusability, and adherence to the open/closed principle.
